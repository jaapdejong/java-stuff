An Intent is exactly what it describes. It's an "intention" to do an action.

An Intent is basically a message to say you did or want something to happen. Depending on the intent, apps or the OS might be listening for it and will react accordingly.

Think of it as a blast email to a bunch of friends, in which you tell your friend John to do something. The other folks will ignore the email, but John will react to it.

To listen for an intent (like the phone ringing, or an SMS is received), you implement a broadcast receiver.

If you want to fire off an intent to do something, like pop up the dialer, you fire off an intent saying you will.
